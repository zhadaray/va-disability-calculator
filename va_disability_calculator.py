#This Python program calculates the Veteran's disability compensation including
    #the financial compensation plus benefits (such as dental service)
#Create dictionaries for 2024 financial compensation rates
#Include any additional compensation per child
#Create a dictionary for additional benefits that are not monetary
#Prompt the user to input the number of dependent child,
    #dependent parents, and if he or she has a spouse
#If the user inputs rating 0, 10, or 20, display the benefits and calculations.
#Ask the user if they would like to learn more about the benefits on my blog post or input another rating.
#Ratings of 0, 10, or 20 have flat rates and benefits. They do not change.
#Display the calculated financial compensation rate along with benefits
#Redirect the user to my blog post about how to file a VA Disability Claim
